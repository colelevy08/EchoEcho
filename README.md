# EchoEcho: A Social Media Platform for Vinyl Record Enthusiasts

EchoEcho is a social media platform designed specifically for vinyl record enthusiasts. It combines the social interaction of Instagram or TikTok with the marketplace functionality of eBay or Depop, but strictly for music-related items. Users can share their record collections, equipment, live concert experiences, and even cover bands. The platform also allows users to buy and sell records and record equipment.

## Project Requirements

### Backend

1. **Flask and SQLAlchemy**: Use Flask as the web framework and SQLAlchemy as the ORM for the backend. This will handle the server-side operations of the application.

2. **Database Models**: Implement at least four models. These could be User, Post, Comment, and Product (for the marketplace). The User and Post models will have a many-to-many relationship.

3. **CRUD Operations**: Implement full CRUD operations on at least one model, following REST conventions. This could be the Post model, where users can create, read, update, and delete posts.

### Frontend

1. **React**: Use React for the frontend to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Implement at least five client-side routes using React Router.

2. **Redux or useContext**: Use Redux or the useContext hook for state management in the application.

### Additional Features

1. **Third-Party API Integration**: Integrate a music-related API to provide additional information about the albums being posted. For example, you could use the Discogs API to fetch album details.

2. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication to allow users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.

3. **Search and Filter**: Implement a search and filter feature in the marketplace to help users find specific records or equipment.

4. **Likes and Comments**: Allow users to like and comment on posts, similar to other social media platforms.

5. **Notifications**: Implement a notification system to alert users of new comments, likes, or messages.

6. **Chat System**: Implement a real-time chat system for users to communicate directly.

## Project Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Research and development phase. Learn about the technologies and APIs you plan to use. Draw out your models and sketch your frontend. Prepare your project proposal. 
    
    Start building your project. Focus on setting up your backend with Flask and SQLAlchemy. Implement your models and CRUD operations. Begin setting up your frontend with React.

2. **Week 2**: Continue working on your frontend. Implement client-side routing, state management with Redux or useContext, and start integrating your backend with your frontend.

    Implement additional features like third-party API integration, authentication, search and filter, likes and comments, notifications, and the chat system.

3. **Week 3**: Finalize your project. Fix any bugs, improve the styling, and prepare for your presentation.

## Helpful Tools

1. **Postman**: Use Postman to test your backend routes before integrating them with your frontend.

2. **Semantic UI React or ReactStrap**: Use these libraries to help with styling your React components.

3. **Google Fonts**: Use Google Fonts to find unique fonts for your application.

4. **Render**: Use Render for hosting your site.

Remember, this is a complex project, so it's important to stay organized and manage your time effectively. Use a Kanban board like Trello or a Github Project Board to keep track of your tasks, and consider using a Pomodoro Timer to manage your work sessions and breaks.
